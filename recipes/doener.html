    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>A very popular take-out especially after a night out at the pub.
    This favorite is so, so tasty--I'm sure once you try it, you'll certainly want to
    make more! Serve with warmed (lightly toasted) pita bread, chili sauce, and a salad
    of shredded cabbage, carrot, onion, and sliced cucumber.</p>
    <p>Also great to add as a topping
    for pizzas. Great to make in advance, slice and freeze.</p>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
    <li>BPreheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
    <li>Combine flour, oregano, salt, garlic powder, onion powder, Italian seasoning, black pepper, and cayenne pepper in a large bowl. Add ground lamb and thoroughly knead with the flour mixture until thoroughly mixed together, about 3 minutes.</li>
    <li>Shape the seasoned ground lamb and place into a loaf pan; set on top of a baking sheet.</li>
    <li>Bake in the preheated oven, turning the loaf halfway to ensure even browning, about 1 hour and 20 minutes.</li>
    <li>Wrap loaf in aluminum foil and let rest, about 10 minutes. Slice as thinly as possible to make the doner kebab pieces.</li>
